# emitls
For year 13 (final year high school) my programming class had an assessment regarding the development of a program to complete a task.

23/2/22
This is day one of my project, at least the actual development stage, so I set up the repository, folders, django project and first app (emission calculator). I started this around half five in the afternoon because I was bored and felt like coding. Additionally I am so utterly depressed about writing an inquiry everyday in a class about programming that to maintain my sense of sanity and self worth I wanted to start something already.

The trello board has been initialized at https://trello.com/b/6CupMqUf/emitls and yes, I actually did plan this through in advance.

Calculator.
  1. The calculator will need an HTML form to collect data from users regarding their usage of various resources.
  2. It will need to take these values and compute the average score.
  3. IF I create accounts, it will need to save this score, possibly with a date.
  4. I could consider creating a slider to show a graphic representation.

Index.
  1. Several pages regarding the option to switch to.
  2. Each page should ideally have a few images if not perhaps a slideshow (vanilla JS).
  3. Certain pages should be recommended based off of user responses.

A lot was set up in remarkably short time, however this is the simple beginnings stage of the project and work is bound to be easier to complete at this stage and become more difficult as time progresses.

Oh and the name was deliberately chosen to be annoying, as every tech company these days seems to rely on stupid naming conventions to promote themselves and their products.

Well, yesterday saw all basic features operating as intended:

Calculator determines range, colours and recommends appropriately.
Options page includes three options in boxes.
About page is dripping with front end hatred.

However, I decided that this was simply not enough and elected to force myself to do Users.
Seeing as I have now spent a day tearing my hair out trying to determine how to do a signup, login and logout, I'd say it's going great -_- .
I've found a youtube tutorial series that I can follow and I hope that will provide the adequate information needed to build the remaining infrastructure.
